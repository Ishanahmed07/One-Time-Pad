# One-Time-Pad
This project aims to implement a One-Time Pad encryption system using Python. The One-Time Pad encryption is a theoretically unbreakable encryption technique if used correctly. It works by combining a plaintext message with a random key of the same length to produce the ciphertext.

# Features
Encrypt plaintext messages using a one-time pad key.

Decrypt ciphertext using the corresponding one-time pad key.

Generate random one-time pad keys.

Support for both text and file encryption/decryption.

Command-line interface for easy usage.
